  * \brief IDM/MOBIL LaneChange Model.
  *
  * A Vehicle mobiliy and its acceleration in a particular lane of the roadway can be determined by IDM Car Following Model.
  * Sometimes a Vehicle can have opportunity to switch its current lane to a desird adjacent lane.
  * LaneChange Model can check the possibility of changing lane for a particular Vehicle based on several factors such as:
  * Driver Politeness Factor, Minimum Safe Distance and Breaking Deceleration to the Vehicle(s).
  * in front and back (the same lane) and in the desired (target) lane.
